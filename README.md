# modulAR-CR_APP
This repository displays the C#- and Python codes that are used in the app and Mirte robot for the creative robotics course 2025-2026

This project explores a human-robot collaboration system that enables intuitive spatial reconfiguration through Augmented Reality and robotic assembly. Users design modular layouts in an AR app, which are translated into coordinates for the Mirte Master robot operating in a beforehand mapped environment.
